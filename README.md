## Follow-Bot
# Project Description
Follow-bot is a project I worked on with 3 other members in a group. It is a robot that carries a payload for the owner of the robot and follows them wirelessly through the usage of utlrasound sensors. The project was created using the arduino and I was responsible for creating the program - through utilising c++ - that utilises the ultrasound sensors so that the robot can follow the user. This directory contains the aforementioned program. Due to the complexity of the project, we were not able to make the motors work due to problems with the schematics, however, in order to render an output to test whether the program was working I utilised the seriel monitor and the program worked perfectly.
